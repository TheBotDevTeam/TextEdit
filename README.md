## About this project
I don't develop this project any more and therefore it is now also open source. If someone would like to develop this project further he should do this gladly and then I would be happy if he would create an pull-request. If I like the update, I'll give that one premium for my other bots and the developer roll on my [discord](https://discord.gg/HD7x2vx).  

## Your own Bot?
I can create your very own bot for you! Does that sound good? If so, please have a look [here](https://www.fiverr.com/basechip/create-your-discord-bot)
# Important
It is important that you enter your [bottoken](https://discordapp.com/developers) in the file KEYS.py, otherwise the bot will not work.
